# Social Media Friend Recommendation System

A lightweight Streamlit web application that recommends potential friends based on a user's profile inputs like **name**, **gender**, **date of birth**, **country**, and **interests**.

This app uses basic **natural language processing (NLP)** and **cosine similarity** to find users with similar tags and recommend them as friends.

## Features

- 🖋️ Streamlit-based simple and clean UI.
- 🔱 Dynamic input fields for:
  - Name
  - Gender (Male, Female, Others)
  - Date of Birth (with wide year range selection)
  - Country (select from all countries)
  - Interests (comma-separated)
- ✨ Fast friend recommendations based on user profile.
- 🌐 Optimized with caching to avoid redundant heavy calculations.
- 📊 Uses `CountVectorizer` + `Linear Kernel` for matching user interests.

## Workflow

1. **Load User Data**: Load existing user data from `SMUsers.csv`.
2. **Preprocess**: Clean and vectorize data using NLP techniques.
3. **Cache Processing**: Heavy operations like vectorization and similarity matrix are cached.
4. **User Input**: User fills in their profile details.
5. **Generate Tags**: Create a profile tag string from user input.
6. **Find Recommendations**: Calculate cosine similarity and recommend top 5 closest profiles.
